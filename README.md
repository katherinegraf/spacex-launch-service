## **What it is**
A Kotlin app that integrates with the SpaceX API to get details about SpaceX launches.

The first iteration of the app intentionally chooses not to store any information in a database, in order to practice combining data from multiple API calls.
The second iteration of the app will be redesigned to make fewer API calls by storing information in a database.

## **How to use it**
- To run the backend, use `./gradlew bootrun`
